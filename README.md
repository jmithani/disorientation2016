# disorientation2016
Website for UChicago Disorientation 2016, a coordinated series of events and information dissemination taking place in Autumn 2016.

## About DisOrientation
DisOrientation runs alongside UChicago's Orientation Week (O-Week), where first years are introduced to the univerisity and college life. DisO has three main goals:

>(i)   Provide a consolidated list of resources geared towards minority students at UChicago, many of which are not widely advertised;

>(ii)  Introduce incoming students to social activism on campus, and share how they can get involved;

>(iii) Educate incoming students about the history of the city, highlighting the University's role in the Southside and emphasizing community centers not a part of the school.

Overall, DisO wants to make students of all backgrounds feel safe at UChicago, as well as encouraging them to branch out from the university community and become more involved with local organizations.

## About the website

The website is designed for both current UChicago students interested in learning more about our project and incoming students who will participate in programming during O-Week. The site is designed primarily with mobile access in mind, as I anticipate many students will reference the schedule on their phones while running around. We have print copies of the "DisO Book" of resources and tips from upperclassmen, but our budget is limited and it is unlikely every one of the 1,000+ first years will get a copy. As such, the website will be the primary source for information about DisO events, DisO volunteers, and the DisO book.
